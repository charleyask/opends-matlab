%% Pre-process EEG data 

% This script implements a processing pipeline for EEG data. This data
% should already have been QC'd. 
%
% 1. Align time series
%
% The first step in this process is to synchronize time series between the 
% eye tracking and simulation logs, such that events and epochs are aligned. 
% Results will be written to file.
% 
% 2. Visualize eye movements
